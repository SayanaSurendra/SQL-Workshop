If it's not there, troubleshoot two potential issues:

1. Confirm you've got an establish database connection. (Refer to `HOW TO - Install MySQL 8.0+`)
2. During MySQL installation, double-check that you added `Samples and Examples` in the setup phase.

If you for some reason could not setup `Samples and Examples` during installation.  
Refer to SQL-script in `03_world_database_backup.zip`
